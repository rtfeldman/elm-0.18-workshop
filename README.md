Getting Started
===============

## Install Elm Tools

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) 7.0.0 or higher

2. Add a plugin for your editor of choice: [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/language-elm), [Sublime Text](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Elm%20Language%20Support), [VS Code](https://github.com/sbrink/vscode-elm), [Light Table](https://github.com/rundis/elm-light), [Vim](https://github.com/lambdatoast/elm.vim), [Emacs](https://github.com/jcollard/elm-mode), [Brackets](https://github.com/lepinay/elm-brackets)

3. Not required, but **highly** recommended: enable "[`elm-format`](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format) on save" in your editor.

4. Run the following command to install all the other Elm tools:

> **Note:** Make sure not to run this command with `sudo`! If it gives you an `EACCESS` error, apply [**this fix**](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions#option-two-change-npms-default-directory) and then re-run the command (still without `sudo`).

```shell
npm install -g elm@0.18.0 elm-test@0.18.12 elm-live@2.7.5 elm-format@0.7.0-exp
```

You can confirm this worked by running:

```shell
elm --version
```

It should print `0.18.0` if everything worked!

## Clone this repository

Run this at the terminal:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-0.18-workshop.git elm-workshop
cd elm-0.18-workshop
```

> **Note:** Tab characters are syntax errors in Elm code, so if your editor uses them for indentation, definitely switch it to spaces for this workshop!

## Start the server

We'll be running a local server for our Elm UI to use. Let's get it set up.

```shell
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

If the server started up successfully, you should see
`> moleculer-runner services` at the end of your terminal.

We're going to leave this server running and not touch it again for the duration
of the workshop, so **don't close it** until the workshop is over!

## Build the Elm UI

Leave the existing terminal running, and open a **second** terminal.

In the new termnal, `cd` into the `elm-workshop/server/` directory again.

Then run this to build the Elm code for the first time:

```shell
elm-live src/Main.elm --output=../server/public/elm.js --dir=../server/public --pushstate
```

> It should say "Server running at" and "LiveReload running on" - but we'll ignore both of those, because we'll instead be using the server we already started running in the previous step!

Leave `elm-live` running and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
in your browser. You should see this in it:

If things aren’t working, the instructor will be happy to help!
